        <p style="font-size: 18px; justify-content: baseline;">Our planet is home to a stunning array of wildlife, each species playing a crucial role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems. However, many of these animals are facing an uncertain future. Endangered species are those whose populations have dwindled to dangerously low levels, putting them at risk of extinction. The causes are numerous—habitat loss, climate change, poaching, and invasive species are just a few of the threats that jeopardize their survival.</p>

          <h4>1. Tarsier</h4>
          <p>Tarsiers are tiny leaping primates found mostly in Bohol, Philippines. A definite tourist attraction when visiting the island, they are fascinating creatures with big eyes, tiny bodies, and long rat-like tails.</p>
          <P>Tarsiers are the only known carnivorous primates and prey on insects, lizards, and sometimes even snakes. They usually cling upright to trees and branches and can live in monogamous pairs.</P>
          <p>Tarsiers are easily stressed and become self-destructive when they are held in captivity or even just touched—so please never cage or pet them.</p>
          <p>The species is not critically endangered but its population is threatened, so let's hope these lovable creatures never get to that critical point.</p>

          <h4>2. Philippine Mouse Deer</h4>
          <p>The critically endangered Philippine mouse deer, also known as pilandok or the Balabac chevrotain, is a unique creature only found in the islands of Palawan. They are absolutely small in stature and resemble exactly what their name describes: a mix of a mouse and a deer.</p>
          <p>A little something you probably didn't know is that it does not belong to the deer family. It is nocturnal and eats mostly plants, leaves, fruits, and sometimes insects.</p>

          <h4> 3. Philippine Forest Turtle</h4>
          <p>The Philippine Forest Turtle, found in Palawan, is among the most critically endangered turtle species in the world.</p>
          <p>For a while, the Philippine Forest Turtle was believed to have been extinct, but a few specimens were found again somewhere in Northern Palawan. This brought the species into existence again in 2004.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, this rediscovery brought about a negative effect as it made poachers get into a frenzy of capturing the turtles to sell as pets, make them into traditional medicine, and even food.</p>

          <h4>4. Philippine Crocodile</h4>
          <p>Isn't that a surprise? Crocodiles are usually feared because they are known as predators and even man-eating animals—so one would have never thought they would come to be endangered.</p>
          <p>The critically endangered Philippine crocodile is said to have a diet of mostly fish, small mammals, birds, and snails—this, in turn, helps farmers in controlling those pests on the rice fields.</p>
          <p>Compared to other crocodiles, the Philippine crocodile is smaller than usual—and grows to about an average of 5 feet long.</p>
